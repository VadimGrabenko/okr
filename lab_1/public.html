    <h1 id="section-public">Public Library</h1>
    <p>A public library is a library, most often a lending library, that is accessible by the general public and is usually funded from public sources, such as taxes. It is operated by librarians and library paraprofessionals, who are also civil servants.</p>

    <p>There are five fundamental characteristics shared by public libraries:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>They are generally supported by taxes (usually local, though any level of government can and may contribute).</li>
        <li>They are governed by a board to serve the public interest.</li>
        <li>They are open to all, and every community member can access the collection.</li>
        <li>They are entirely voluntary, no one is ever forced to use the services provided.</li>
        <li>They provide library and information services without charge.</li>
    </ul>
